# DNA_sequence_Analyser

## Overview
This is a simple terminal application with a Text-based User Interface (TUI) designed for the analysis of DNA sequences. The app provides a set of functionalities to manipulate and analyze DNA sequences, making it a handy tool for bioinformatics tasks.

## Features
1. **Nucleotide Base Frequencies:**
   - Calculate the frequencies of each nucleotide base in the DNA sequence.

2. **Transcription:**
   - Transcribe the DNA sequence into an RNA sequence.

3. **Translation:**
   - Translate the RNA sequence into proteins, represented as amino acids.

4. **Reverse Complement:**
   - Calculate the reverse complement of the DNA sequence.

5. **GC Content:**
   - Calculate the GC content of the DNA sequence.

6. **Codon Frequencies:**
   - Calculate the frequencies of codons in the DNA sequence.

7. **Random Mutations:**
   - Perform random point mutations on the DNA sequence. The user can specify the number of mutations.

8. **Find Motif:**
   - Search for a motif in the DNA sequence.

9. **Consensus String and Profile Matrix:**
   - Given a collection of at most 10 DNA strings of equal length in FASTA format, the app can return a consensus string and a profile matrix for the collection.

## How to Use (Linux)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dna-analysis-terminal-app.git
   cd dna-analysis-terminal-app
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python Main.py
   ```
   Note: Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your Linux system. You may need to use `python3` instead of `python` depending on your system configuration.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to utilize the various functionalities.

Now, you can explore the world of DNA analysis on your Linux system by executing the provided command in the terminal. Enjoy analyzing DNA sequences with this simple yet powerful terminal application!
